# PokeDetails
My adaption on utilizing the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co) and it was a very fun project to do. 

It is currently fetching the first 150 Pokemon using the async/await syntax and displaying along with their info in a CSS grid.

The app also takes into consideration responsiveness. Depending on the device that it is used, the columns will change to properly fit the content.
