# PokeDetails
I had a lot of fun working on my project which involved utilizing the PokeAPI.

At present, the application fetches data for the first 150 Pokemon using the async/await syntax and displays them, along with their information, in a CSS grid. Moreover, the app has been designed to be responsive. Depending on the device being used, the columns will automatically adjust to fit the content, thereby ensuring optimal user experience.
